Abstractions provide a way of handling complexity.

OOP is essentially about modelling abstractions, by using classes and objects. 

A class models and abstaction by defining the properties and behaviours of the objects which are instances of the class.

A contract for a class defines which services the class offers.

An Implementation of a class defines <<how>> the class provides the services.
